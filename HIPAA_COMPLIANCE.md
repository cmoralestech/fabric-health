# HIPAA Compliance Documentation

## Overview
This medical-grade API handles Protected Health Information (PHI) and is designed to meet HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) requirements.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: NextAuth.js with secure session management
- **Role-based Access Control**: ADMIN, SURGEON, STAFF roles with granular permissions
- **Session Security**: JWT tokens with secure storage and expiration
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds

### 2. Data Protection
- **PHI Sanitization**: All data is sanitized before storage and transmission
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all PHI fields
- **Data Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (database encryption)
- **Access Logging**: Complete audit trail for all PHI access

### 3. Network Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications encrypted
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers for XSS, CSRF, and clickjacking protection
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks
- **IP Tracking**: All requests logged with IP addresses for audit purposes

### 4. Audit & Monitoring
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All PHI access, modifications, and errors logged
- **User Activity Tracking**: Complete audit trail of user actions
- **Security Event Monitoring**: Failed login attempts, unauthorized access attempts
- **Data Access Reports**: Track who accessed what PHI and when

### 5. Data Handling
- **Minimum Necessary**: Only required PHI fields are exposed
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Secure Deletion**: PHI properly removed when no longer needed
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with access controls

Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
```

## Audit Logging

All PHI access is logged with:
- User identification
- Timestamp
- Action performed
- Resource accessed
- IP address
- User agent
- Success/failure status
- Error messages (if applicable)

## Data Flow Security

1. **Input**: PHI validated and sanitized
2. **Processing**: Role-based access controls applied
3. **Storage**: Encrypted database storage
4. **Transmission**: HTTPS encryption
5. **Audit**: Complete access logging

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures
1. Immediate containment
2. Assessment and analysis
3. Notification procedures
4. Recovery and restoration
5. Post-incident review

### Breach Notification
- Internal notification within 1 hour
- Patient notification within 60 days
- HHS notification within 60 days
- Media notification if 500+ affected

## Training Requirements

### Workforce Training
- HIPAA basics and PHI protection
- Security awareness
- Incident reporting procedures
- Password security
- Social engineering awareness

### Technical Training
- Secure coding practices
- API security
- Database security

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks
1. **Unauthorized Access**: Mitigated by authentication and authorization
2. **Data Breach**: Mitigated by encryption and access controls
3. **Insider Threats**: Mitigated by audit logging and role separation
4. **System Vulnerabilities**: Mitigated by security headers and input validation

### Risk Mitigation
- Regular security assessments
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Security updates
- Monitoring and alerting
